- MOST IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE EMOJIS in any scripts, comments, or code.
- Every script file auto-imports almost every script in the `helpers` directory on build/install, so you MUST check for existing functions and variables before adding new ones, read the existing `helpers/*.sh` scripts first
- When adding new helper scripts, ensure they have unique function names to avoid conflicts
- Helpers functions can be used across all commands and utilities, using the name `_helpers.sh`, you MUST check for existing functions before adding new ones, read the existing `_helpers.sh` script first
- When creating autocomplete scripts, create both bash and fish versions for compatibility, example:
  - `commands/.../_autocomplete.sh`
  - `commands/.../_autocomplete.fish`
- For autocomplete scripts, follow the existing structure in other autocomplete scripts in the project
- The shebang line for all shell scripts is automatically set during build/install, do not include it in your scripts
- You can only test scripts after committing them, then running `epx self-update` to rebuild/install the updated version
- If you think a helper function would be generally useful, consider moving it to the helper directory, then add it `GLOBAL_INCLUDES` in the `link.sh` file
- Follow the existing code style and structure in the project for consistency
- In the `epx` directory, use underscores (_) for file names instead of hyphens (-) to ensure compatibility across different systems, after build/install the commands will be accessible with hyphens
- When creating utility scripts in `epx/utils`, ensure that the function names are prefixed with `__epx_<script_name>` to avoid naming conflicts, and follow the existing naming conventions
- When adding helper functions in the epx/utils scripts, ensure they are declared as local functions within the script to avoid polluting the global namespace, the prefix them with `__epx_<script_name>__`
- For any network-related scripts, ensure to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 scenarios where applicable
- After creating scripts in `epx/utils`, remember to update the main command scripts to utilize these utilities as needed
  - Add it to `EPX_UTILS` array in `epx.sh`, with appropriate comments
  - Source the utility script
  - Add the command to the main _autocomplete.* scripts for both bash and fish
- When creatuing new commands, make sure to add it to their respective *.help.sh files and add it to the README.md feature list, and ensure to follow the existing structure and style in those files for consistency
