- every script file auto-imports almost every script in the helper directory on build/install, so you can use any helper function in your scripts without needing to source them individually
- when adding new helper scripts, ensure they have unique function names to avoid conflicts
- helpers functions can be used across all commands and utilities, using the name `_helpers.sh`
- when creating autocomplete scripts, create both bash and fish versions for compatibility, example:
  - `commands/.../_autocomplete.sh`
  - `commands/.../_autocomplete.fish`
- for autocomplete scripts, follow the existing structure in other autocomplete scripts in the project
- the shebang line for all shell scripts is automatically set during build/install, do not include it in your scripts
- you can only test scripts after committing them, then running `epx self-update` to rebuild/install the updated version
- if you think a helper function would be generally useful, consider moving it to the helper directory, then add it `GLOBAL_INCLUDES` in the `link.sh` file
- follow the existing code style and structure in the project for consistency
- in the `epx` directory, use underscores (_) for file names instead of hyphens (-) to ensure compatibility across different systems, after build/install the commands will be accessible with hyphens
- for any network-related scripts, ensure to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 scenarios where applicable
- after creating scripts in `epx/utils`, remember to update the main command scripts to utilize these utilities as needed
  - add it to `EPX_UTILS` array in `epx.sh`, with appropriate comments
  - source the utility script
